Scale out (horizontal scaling): To scale out is to add more virtual machines to the system. An example might be adding more virtual machine instances to application layer.
Scale up (vertical scaling): To scale up is to add resources to the existing virtual machine in a system. An example might be to add more storage to database layer.
Scale down: To scale down is to release acquired resources, either by releasing some virtual machines or by removing some of the virtual machines resources.
Service Level Agreement (SLA): SLA is an agreement outlining a specific service commitment made between contract parties such as service provider and its customer. The agreement describes the overall service, support details, finan- cial aspects of service delivery, penalties, terms and conditions, and performance metrics that govern service delivery.
Service Level Objective (SLO): SLO is specific measurable characteristic of the SLA such as availability, throughput, response time, or quality. An example of response time as an objective is: ``95% of the requests to an Internet application should be answered in less than 100 milliseconds measured over 24 hours''.
