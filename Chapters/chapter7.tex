AppElastic algorithm proposed in this thesis in order to solve automated scaling of virtual machines for cloud hosted application. It is designed and implemented to be proactive and threshold based automated scaling algorithm. To proactively scale the virtual machine resources, AppElastic algorithm is aided by ARIMA forecasting model. These two components introduced in this thesis work hand in had to provide best QoS guaranties at the same time reducing the cost.
\\
ElasticSim simulator developed in thesis has aided in better testing and evaluation of AppElastic algorithm. Evaluation of AppElastic algorithm shows that fine grained provisioning of virtual machine resources can provide best QoS guaranties and save cost. However, ARIMA model developed in this thesis still has forecast error of 1.5\%. Due to forecast accuracy it may lead to SLA violations where forecasted workload are less than actual workload. In the evaluation of cost, cost benefits can be achieved by using different instance purchasing options and AppElastic algorithm is equipped to aid different instance types.
\\
Nevertheless, the future work for AppElastic algorithm can be focused on testing it on production environment and in combination with efficient forecasting models. By integrating AppElastic algorithm with forecasting models, an online program can be developed to scale any cloud hosted application.
