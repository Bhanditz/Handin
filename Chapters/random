To evaluate our approach and the AppElastic algorithm at large-scale, a simulation based mode, called ElasticSim, to implement the scalability components acting as the scalability components of Amazon EC2 is developed. ElasticSim is fed with workload trace from Citrix audio/video conferencing application. The results show that optimizing the scalability thresholds and adopting proactive scalability can mitigate the resource provisioning overhead with cost benefits.

Based on the above mentioned classification, AppElastic algorithm developed in this thesis can be described as a customer oriented approach to elasticity which is a proactive automatic policy based Horizontal scaling mechanism. The purpose of AppElastic algorithm is to reduce cost and maintain the QoS for the users.
